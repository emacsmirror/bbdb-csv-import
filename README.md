# bbdb-csv-import

Import csv into Emacsâ€™s bbdb contact database

Works out of the box with csv exported from Thunderbird, Gmail Linkedin,
Outlook.com/hotmail, and probably others.

Documentation is at [./bbdb-csv-import.el](bbdb-csv-import.el).

Bug tracker is through gitlab, https://gitlab.com/iankelling/bbdb-csv-import
